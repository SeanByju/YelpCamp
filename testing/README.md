## What packages are in this project?
In order to run the automation, it uses the following libraries:
Selenium: automates your web browser and allows you to write test scripts.
Pytest: provides features to parameterize and assert your test functions and connect to allure for test reporting more seemlessly.
Allure: write test reports.

'''bash
python -m pytest --alluredir=Reports_LoginPage_10-27-2022/ TestCases/test_yelpCampLoginPage.py -s -v
'''

## Demo
'''python

Use the venv folder to set up your environment without having to install the libraries on your computer. (Set your directory to the testing folder for simplicity)

'''bash
